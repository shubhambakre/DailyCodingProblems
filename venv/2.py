# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Facebook.
#
# Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
#
# For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.
#
# Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

# Python3 implementation of the approach

# Function that returns true if the array
# can be made strictly decreasing
# with at most one change
def check(arr, n):

	modify = 0

	# Check whether the last element needs
	# to be modify or not
	if (arr[n - 1] >= arr[n - 2]):
		arr[n-1] = arr[n-2] - 1
		modify += 1

	# Check whether the first element needs
	# to be modify or not
	if (arr[0] <= arr[1]):
		arr[0] = arr[1] + 1
		modify += 1

	# Loop from 2nd element to the 2nd last element
	for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):

		# Check whether arr[i] needs to be modified
		if (arr[i - 1] <= arr[i] and arr[i + 1] <= arr[i]) or \
		(arr[i - 1] >= arr[i] and arr[i + 1] >= arr[i]):

			# Modifying arr[i]
			arr[i] = (arr[i - 1] + arr[i + 1]) // 2
			modify += 1

			# Check if arr[i] is equal to any of
			# arr[i-1] or arr[i + 1]
			if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1] or arr[i] == arr[i + 1]):
				return False


	# If more than 1 modification is required
	if (modify > 1):
		return False

	return True

# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
	arr = [10, 5, 11, 31]
	n = len(arr)

	if (check(arr, n)):
		print("Yes")
	else:
		print("No")
